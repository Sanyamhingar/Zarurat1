      <p style="margin: 3rem;"><b>Zarurat</b>, as the name and emblem signifies “helping the deprived”, is a non-profit student-run organization whose main motive is to help the underprivileged children residing in nearby neighborhood, by providing them with the basic need and right of a human, i.e. primary education. The philosophy of the team is “each one; teach one”. Zarurat helps in overall development of a child and provides a platform where a child can educate himself / herself and hone his skills and become a better citizen as well as a better version of themselves.
        
        The foundation of Zarurat was laid in the year 2011 in JECRC Foundation and in the subsequent year it was brought to JECRC University by its first batch of students. In the initial days, surveys were conducted in the nearby areas of the campus to get a rough estimate of the number of children and accordingly the classes were started. Regular classes are being conducted 5 days a week which include a G.K class on each on every wednesday of the week. Also every Saturday we plan  extra-curricular activities like sports, dance, music, art & craft are planned for the kids.
        
         Zarurat is a place where we not only educate the kids but also enrich them with lots of Cultural and Religious values.  We as a Family celebrate almost all the festivals with the kids with the spirit of enthusiasm and commemoration. It instills in them the value of culture, integrity, secularity and harmony. Apart from this, events like Tree Plantation Drive, Diya Decoration, Medical Health check-up Drive, Clothes Distribution Event, Mask distribution, Annual Event, etc., are organized every year for the children.
        
        Also every year we make sure that we give at least 3-4 outings to the kids to the places like Jaipur Zoo,  Monuments etc which provides a sense of enjoyment and also acts as a source of knowledge for them because no matter what our primary goal is to give them a good education. Zarurat volunteers also pay regular visits to old age homes, schools for deaf and dumb and a government school in the nearby village.Not only this, our Coordinators and volunteers go to the nearby Government schools each day to teach the kids over there because we focus on providing a quality education to as much students as we can. Zarurat has come up with a Basic Computer Knowledge program for underprivileged children. During the pandemic also, the team was connected with these children in online mode and delivered different E-Modules for their growth.</p>

It gave me a warm environment to make my place as an individual filled with confidence, patience and gratefulness rather than regretting things that couldn't happen. I began to see  the positive side to everything and the children's smile you see on outer side make us realize in ourself what change we are making and I personally love it. 
                        It also helped me experience a professional environment prior to an actual job making me prepared for it before hand. 
                        I will always be thankful for it and the lessons learnt here have made a mark and will be evident in the future. "
